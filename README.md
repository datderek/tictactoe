## Goal:
The purpose of this project was to practice utilizing Objects and Factories to compartmentalize my code into distinct units. Thus, reducing the amount of global code.

## Lessons Learned:
- How to use IIFE to create modules
- Documentating and creating comments helps code readability and complexity

## What I can improve:
Trying to get better at defining the scope of a given class.
